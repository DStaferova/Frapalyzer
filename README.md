The product provides an algorithm of apocope search in French text. 

The corpus of apocopes can be found in [dict_apo_auto.csv](/data/dict_apo_auto.csv). It currently contains 1295 apocopes with their full forms. 

Some relevant statistics can be found in [dict_apo_aug.csv](/data/dict_apo_aug.csv).

The dictionary of full forms which is used by our algorithm (based on Le Grand Robert) can be found in [list_words.csv](/data/list_words.csv).

The list of words encountered in the articles parsed from [Le Point](http://www.lepoint.fr) can be found in [datasets.csv](/data/datasets.csv).
