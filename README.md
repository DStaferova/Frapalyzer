The product provides an algorithm of apocope search in French text. 

The corpus of apocopes can be found in [dict_apo_auto.csv](/blob/master/data/dict_apo_auto.csv). It currently contains 1295 apocopes with their full forms. 

Some relevant statistics can be found in [dict_apo_aug.csv](/blob/master/data/dict_apo_aug.csv).
